# Linear Discriminant  Analysis 

* Dimensionality reduction technique
* Pre processing step for pattern classification
* Component Axis  + axis that maximize separation
* LDA is supervised because of dependent variable 


## Steps

* d-dimensional mean vector for different classes from dataset
* Scatter matrices
* Eigen vectors
* Sort eigen vectors
* k largest , d*k matrix W
* Y= X*W( W  n*d dimensional matrix)
