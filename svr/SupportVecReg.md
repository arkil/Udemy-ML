# Support Vector Regression

* Support vector machines support linear and non linear regression 
* SVR tries to fit as many instances as possible on street while limiting margin violations
* Width is controlled by hyper parameter epsilon
* Consider each data point as it's own dimension
* In SVR goal is error should not exceed  threshold

## Steps

* Collect a training set  ={X,Y}
* Choose a kernel and it's parameter and regularization as needed
* Form correlation matrix
* Get contraction coefficients
* Create estimator
